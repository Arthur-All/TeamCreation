# TeamCreation
TeamCreation is using VS22.
DB: SQL Server.
I will add, automapper and DTOS, JWT, and also create a new table to connect RegistreTeams with people (Entidades.)

Overall the project is pretty basic, the only difference is the abstraction, of the entities, repositories, and services, making
the project cleaner.
